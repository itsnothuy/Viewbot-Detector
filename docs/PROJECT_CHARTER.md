# Viewbot Guard - Project Charter

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Viewbot Guard - Real-time Fake Viewer Detection System  
**Project Manager:** [Your Name]  
**Start Date:** [Current Date]  
**Expected Duration:** 8-10 weeks  
**Project Type:** Portfolio/Production-Ready System

## Business Justification
- **Problem Statement:** Streaming platforms lose credibility and revenue due to artificially inflated viewer counts from viewbots
- **Business Value:** Protect creator trust, maintain platform integrity, ensure accurate analytics
- **Success Metrics:** >90% bot detection precision, <1% false positive rate, sub-10s detection latency

## Stakeholders
- **Primary:** Platform Trust & Safety Team
- **Secondary:** Creator Operations, Data Engineering, Infrastructure
- **End Users:** Content Creators, Platform Viewers, Moderation Teams

## Project Scope
### **In Scope:**
- Real-time viewbot detection pipeline
- HLS/LL-HLS transport analysis
- CMCD telemetry integration
- Progressive enforcement (counting suppression → challenges → blocking)
- Live dashboards and moderation UI
- Docker-based development environment

### **Out of Scope:**
- Production cloud deployment (Phase 2)
- Multiple streaming protocols beyond HLS
- Advanced ML model training infrastructure
- Legal enforcement mechanisms

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| False positives affecting legitimate users | High | Extensive testing, progressive enforcement |
| Evasion by sophisticated bots | Medium | Multi-signal approach, regular model updates |
| Performance impact on streaming | High | Efficient streaming architecture, async processing |
| Privacy concerns | Medium | Session-based analysis, no PII storage |

## Technology Stack Approval
- **Streaming:** Redpanda (Kafka API)
- **Processing:** Apache Flink (PyFlink)
- **Storage:** ClickHouse (columnar OLAP)
- **Monitoring:** Grafana + custom dashboards
- **Player:** hls.js with CMCD instrumentation
- **Challenges:** Cloudflare Turnstile
